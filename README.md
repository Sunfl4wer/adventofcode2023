# Advent of Code 2023
This year I decided to solve AoC in Rust

# Day 1
## Problem statement
- Given a string consists of ASCII characters and digits we need to find first and last possible
digit in that string and from a two digits number. 
- The number can be a single digit from *1* to *9* or it's English word *one* to *nine*.
- Example: *2dffdsfonetwonineight* result in 28
## Approach
Find first match from both ends of a line
